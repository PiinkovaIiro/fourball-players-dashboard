  "Valimaki, Sami": {
    "bio": "Sami Välimäki is a 25-year-old Finnish professional golfer who competes on the European Tour/DP World Tour. The established tour competitor has multiple European Tour victories to his name, including a win at the Oman Open, and has built his professional career after a notable amateur stint in Finland.",
    "strengths": "Välimäki excels on the greens with an impressive putting strokes gained of +0.50, ranking among his strongest skills alongside solid approach play at +0.39 strokes gained. His tournament simulation shows consistent competitive potential with a 22.0% top-10 probability and 10.4% chance of finishing in the top-5, reflecting his ability to contend regularly.",
    "weaknesses": "His biggest weakness comes off the tee where he loses -0.32 strokes gained, while also struggling around the greens at -0.15 strokes gained. A consistency standard deviation of 2.72 indicates some volatility in his round-to-round performance.",
    "recent_form": "Välimäki's recent form shows some decline, with his last 20 rounds averaging just +0.04 strokes gained compared to +0.35 over his last 50 rounds. This represents a notable drop from his stronger mid-term performance, though his last 100 rounds average of -0.02 suggests he's still finding his overall rhythm.",
    "playing_style": "Välimäki employs a precision-based approach built around exceptional putting and solid iron play, compensating for driving limitations. His statistical profile suggests a player who relies on accuracy and short-game skills rather than power, making him well-suited for courses that reward strategic positioning over distance.",

The British golfer has also competed in major championships and spent time in the United States developing his game. His statistical profile shows he competes at a high professional level with 103 rounds of analyzed data.",
    "strengths": "Horsfield's strongest asset is his putting game, gaining +0.14 strokes per round on the greens, which provides a solid foundation for scoring. His approach play is also reliable at +0.03 strokes gained, showing he can find greens consistently. While his overall statistics show room for improvement, his putting prowess gives him the ability to capitalize on scoring opportunities.",
    "weaknesses": "Horsfield struggles significantly around the green, losing -0.43 strokes per round in the short game area, which limits his ability to save par and convert birdie chances. His overall tee-to-green game costs him -0.51 strokes per round, and his consistency rating of 2.72 indicates he experiences notable round-to-round variation in performance.",
    "recent_form": "Horsfield's recent form shows a concerning downward trend, with his last 20 rounds averaging -0.82 strokes gained compared to -0.62 over his last 100 rounds. His last 50 rounds at -0.77 confirm this declining trajectory, suggesting he's currently struggling to find the form that brought him success on the European Tour.",
    "playing_style": "Horsfield employs a putting-focused game style, relying on his strong work on the greens to offset weaknesses in other areas. His statistical profile suggests a conservative approach player who depends on solid iron play and exceptional putting to remain competitive at the highest level.",
